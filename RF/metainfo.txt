Description:       'First, this quantlet constructs 4 kinds of default random forest models to predict the outcome of Bank Tele-Marketing. The 4 kinds of default RF models have different input variables. Choosing the best default model by AUC, we tune the parameters "mtry" and "ntree" by Algorithm tuneRF. Then we construct the tune RF model. Using the validation data to predice the result, we get the AUC. Finally, given that the parameter mtry is the most important parameter to construct the RF model, we use other two methods to tune the parameter "mtry". It takes lots of time to choose the best parameter "mtry". However, the results donâ€™t improve much.'
