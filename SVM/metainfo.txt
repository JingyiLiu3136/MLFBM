Description:       'Use Support Vector Machine model to predict the Bank Telemarketing Result.  The default SVM model already has good accuracy. However, it has a problem in calculating AUC because SVM is the binary classifier which return the value of 0 or 1 not probability. So we just calculate the accuracy in SVM model. However, the accuracy indicate can't give the signal that which mode, the default or tuned SVM model, is better for this project.'
